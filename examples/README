The configuration file currently supports the following sections:

* [hosts]
* [devices]
* [disktype]
* [diskcount]
* [stripesize]
* [vgs]
* [pools]
* [lvs]
* [mountpoints]
* {host-specific-data-for-above}
* [clients]
* [volume]
* [snapshot]

More to come.

Of the above, the tool itself does not mandate most of the values. The above can
be split into multiple files also called as `configurations'.

* Brick configuration.
* Volume configuration.
* client configuration.
* geo-replication configuration.
* snapshot configuration.
* NFS Ganesha configuration.
* Samba configuration.

The above configurations and the necessary minimal sections needed for each
configurations are explained below.

# Brick configuration:

* [hosts]
* [devices]
* [disktype]
* [diskcount]
* [stripesize]

# Volume configuration

* [hosts]
* [volume]
